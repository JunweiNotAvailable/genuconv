# Jubbo – AI Meeting Performance Auditor

> **Make every meeting count.**

Most meeting tools just record, transcribe, and summarize.
Jubbo goes further: it tells you **what actually happened, what went wrong, and how to make the next one better.**

---

## Goal

Turn every meeting into a **learning loop** — not just for individuals, but for the entire team.

Jubbo listens, analyzes, and delivers a **Post-Meeting Diagnostic Report** so you can:

* Identify wasted time (repeated topics, long tangents, unnecessary loops)
* Highlight vague points or unresolved decisions
* Show who dominated vs who barely spoke
* Detect missed opportunities to go deeper or assign actions
* Suggest specific ways to make the *next* meeting shorter, sharper, and more productive

The goal: **cut wasted time, boost clarity, and make meetings genuinely valuable.**

## Why Jubbo?

Existing apps (Otter, Fireflies, etc.) give you notes and summaries — but they don’t tell you:

* *Where did we waste time?*
* *Which points stayed unresolved?*
* *Who’s dominating? Who’s silent?*
* *How can we run this better next time?*

Jubbo fills that gap, helping teams save hours each week and improve collaboration.

## Next Steps

1. Build out the **Post-Meeting Diagnostic Report** template (core value).
2. Integrate with existing meeting workflows (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet).
3. Expand to **personal coaching** (optional) so individuals get private tips alongside team-level reports.

It’s your **AI meeting coach** — making sure every meeting is worth everyone’s time.
